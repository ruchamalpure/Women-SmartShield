# SmartShield: IoT-Based Emergency Alert Device for Womenâ€™s Safety

# ðŸ“– Project Overview
SmartShield is an IoT-based personal safety device designed to assist women in alerting emergency contacts during unsafe situations. By pressing an emergency switch, the device immediately sends an alert email containing the userâ€™s real-time location obtained through the LAN connection and a photo to a set of emergency contacts.

Built using a Raspberry Pi, this project incorporates an emergency switch to trigger the alert, a LAN-based location tracking feature, and a camera to capture images in real time.
